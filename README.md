# K-Means Clustering Project for Mall Customers Dataset

This repository showcases a k-means clustering analysis on customer data from a shopping mall. The goal is to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The project uses Python with scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore and analyze customer data to segment customers into clusters based on their annual income and spending score. We employ k-means clustering, a popular unsupervised learning technique, to identify distinct customer segments.

## Project Structure

- `data/`
  - `Mall_Customers.xlsx` : Dataset containing customer information.
- `notebooks/`
  - `K-Means_Clustering_Mall_Customers.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook with full project code and analysis.
- `README.md` : Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt` : List of required Python packages.

## Data Description

- `CustomerID` : Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender` : Gender of the customer.
- `Age` : Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)` : Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)` : Spending score of the customer, ranging from 1 to 100.
